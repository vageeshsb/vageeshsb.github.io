Hi,

I am a PhD student in the Department of [Mechanical Engineering](https://mecheng.iisc.ac.in) at the [Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru](https://iisc.ac.in), working with [Prof. G. K. Ananthasuresh](https://mecheng.iisc.ac.in/people/g-k-ananthasuresh/) in M2D2 Lab (Multidisciplinary Multiscale Design and Device Lab). My research interest lies primarily in the field of solid mechanics which gets diversified with methods and applications into the subfields of computational mechanics, structural optimization, compliant mechanism design, and 4D printing.

Last year, I worked as a research intern at GE Aerospace to develop a robotic inspection tool for the aeroplane engines. Previously, I also worked as a R&D intern with IFB Appliances on hygienic cleaning of cloths inside the washing machine using ozone generator.

I irregularly upload videos of [hyperloop demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFaFdv4PZc8), [CAD modeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whIiM0apWSo), and [sometimes nonsense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cVR1LfYEkk) in my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@WeAsBee). You can also find me mostly reposting in [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vageesh-singh-baghel-1ba83a133/).
